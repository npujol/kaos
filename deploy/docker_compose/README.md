# Deploying with docker-compose

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Steps

1. Build the docker images

```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. Start docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the project, and you should be able to login using http://127.0.0.1:8000.
